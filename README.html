<p>Cards-based personal notebook site for Advanced Front End class</p>

<p>This is built from a customized version of the <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML 5 Boilerplate</a> <a href="http://www.initializr.com/">Responsive Design Template</a>.</p>

<p>It has had some modifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boilerplate content to start out a web development notebook with representative sections</li>
<li>Addition of a <em>scss</em> folder for local modifications</li>
<li>Addition of a <em>local.scss</em> file to begin customizations</li>
<li>Some minor tweaks to the menu using scss</li>
</ul>

<p>Your job is to make modifications as required by assignment two and later assignments, then to use this notebook as a means of recording what you&#8217;ve learned as part of this class.</p>
