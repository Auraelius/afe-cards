Cards-based personal notebook site for Advanced Front End class

This is built from a customized version of the [HTML 5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) [Responsive Design Template](http://www.initializr.com/).

It has had some modifications:

* Boilerplate content to start out a web development notebook with representative sections
* Addition of a _scss_ folder for local modifications
* Addition of a _local.scss_ file to begin customizations

Your job is to make modifications as required by assignment two and later assignments, then to use this notebook as a means of recording what you've learned as part of this class.
